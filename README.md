# EndPoint: API Tester

This is a tool like Postman but simplest.
Just send a GET, POST, PUT or DELETE HTTP request on a server and get it's response.

# Build

You need JavaFX 14, you can download it [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

I use the language level 14 of Java, if you want to use Java 11, you need to refactor some Switches/Cases

Tested (and compiled) on Windows 10 and IntelliJ
